# backup

This is a way for me to play around with different commands as a way to mimic the backing up function of git.

This is not meant to be any better than git, but rather just a way to test my abilities.

Steps to Install the Repository:

1. Make sure you have git installed on your device
2. Open the Terminal and type: git clone https://github.com/jsonjj/backup.git
3. Run backup.sh init <working_dir>
